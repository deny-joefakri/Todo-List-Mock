### Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- **`dio`** (`^5.3.3`): A powerful HTTP client for Dart, which is used to make network requests to the API. It's easy to use and supports interceptors, global configuration, and more.
- **`pretty_dio_logger`** (`^1.3.1`): A logging interceptor for Dio, which is used to log network requests and responses for debugging purposes.
- **`provider`** (`^6.0.0`): A state management library used to manage the application's state in a clean and scalable way.
- **`flutter_dotenv`** (`^5.1.0`): A library to load environment variables from a `.env` file, useful for configuring API endpoints or other environment-specific settings.
- **`equatable`** (`^2.0.5`): A helper library that makes it easier to compare objects in Dart, particularly useful for state management in Flutter.
- **`dartz`** (`^0.10.1`): A functional programming library for Dart, used in the project for handling operations like error handling, option types, etc.
- **`get_it`** (`^7.6.4`): A service locator for dependency injection, used to manage dependencies and make the code more modular and testable.
